"""The abuse budget: who is calling, what they may spend, and what a refusal says.

Moved out of app.py whole. The knobs arrive as PARAMETERS, not module reads: app keeps
the module-level aliases (RATE_READ, CLIENT_IP_HEADER, MAX_BUCKETS, ...) that both the
tests' monkeypatch.setattr(app, ...) and config.override() re-bind, and passes them into
take()/refund()/client_ip() on every call — a config read here would bypass both mutation
paths and silently break them. The mutable state (_buckets, _identities, _requests, the
waiter slots, the proxy evidence) lives here and is re-exported by app as the SAME
objects, so app._buckets.clear() and friends keep clearing what the limiter reads.

The core is a token bucket per (client IP, kind). `burst` is the bucket's capacity, and
defaults to one minute's worth because that is what a per-minute budget means. A budget
measured over a *day* needs the two apart: the capacity is the whole day's allowance and
`per_min` is only the rate that hands it back. Folded together, a 20-rooms-per-day budget
would be a bucket holding 0.0139 tokens, which never reaches the 1.0 a grant costs — the
limit would refuse everything.

    twice, and it was not: a client polling at its ceiling sits permanently inside the
    last quarter of its budget, so *every* reply it got carried a footer and *none* of them
    could be cached. Measured on production, 47.7% of room reads were `bypass` at the edge
    against a 7.2% hit rate — the cache switched itself off for exactly the callers
    generating the most load.

    Lowering the threshold does not fix that: a client pinned at its ceiling is permanently
    inside whatever band is chosen. What fixes it is emitting on a *stride* of the remaining
    budget — roughly every `per_min // 24` requests, so about six warnings across the warning
    band and the rest of the replies shareable. At the production read budget of 600/min that
    is one footer every 25 requests; the other 24 can be served from the edge.

    The stride scales with the budget rather than being a constant, because a deployment with
    a small budget has no requests to spare: at anything under 24/min it is 1, which is the
    every-reply behaviour this replaces. A caller cannot step over a stride without landing
    on it, so the warning is never skipped, only thinned.

    `(left + 1) % stride` rather than `left % stride` so that the multiple is never *zero
    left*: a caller pinned at its ceiling is granted a token the instant one refills and
    would otherwise sit on the one value that always warns, which is the case this exists to
    remove. It lands on stride-1 instead — 24, 49, 74 … at 600/min.

    Reads only. A write reply is `no-store` whatever it carries — it mutates — so thinning
    its footer buys no cacheability and costs a writer its pacing. Sharing one helper made
    that easy to miss: at the production write budget of 300/min the stride is 12, which

    The degradation above stays: the caller gets the data it would have got anyway. What

    same bytes as one after no wait at all, so "sleep, then retry" and "poll straight
    back" look identical, and a caller with no other signal picks the second and spends
    its read budget at wire speed. Which cap was hit is named because the remedies differ:
    reduce your own concurrency, or wait for the instance to quieten.

    `?format=json` carries the same verdict as the view's `wait_held`. `ip` is passed in
