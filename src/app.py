def _rooms_stamp() -> tuple:
    """A cheap value that changes whenever the room list changes *structurally*. One small
    file read against a ~46k-file walk.

    This is what makes the cache correct rather than merely quick, and the ordering is the
    whole argument: store.append, the create path and the reaper all bump these counters
    *after* the record is on disk (or gone from it), so a stamp read before the walk can
    never be newer than the data the walk sees. A stale view is therefore never served,
    whatever order two concurrent requests interleaved in — a /rooms request that walks the
    pre-write state while a writer is still in fsync, the reaper or the create lock caches
    that view under the *old* stamp, and the stamp is part of the cache key, so a request
    that reads the new stamp is not looking it up. It does not have to be found and
    rejected: it is simply not on the way to any later answer. Nothing has to invalidate
    anything for that to hold, which is why it survives a second worker — and it is why
    this is now the whole mechanism rather than half of one. Keying on the stamp instead of
    storing it beside the value is also what leaves no read-then-validate window between
    finding an entry and using it, so there is nothing here for a concurrent eviction to
    race (the bug class of #376/#229). What it costs is that a superseded entry is not
    reclaimed when its stamp moves; MAX_ROOMS_CACHE is what bounds that.

    That argument holds for every key here, and `messages` is deliberately not one of them.
    It is a single global lifetime counter, not per-room, so one message anywhere aged out
    every listing: measured at ~24 messages/second against a 3s window, the stamp turned
    over ~72 times per window, the hit rate was 0, and every /rooms request walked all
    10,240 rooms — which made newfstatat the busiest syscall on the box by an order of
    magnitude. What that precision bought was discarded immediately downstream anyway:
    ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS already declares 3s of staleness acceptable and the CDN serves the
    result up to EDGE_CACHE_SECONDS stale on top of it.

    So the split is structural-exact, recency-bounded. A room appearing (rooms_created),
    a room disappearing (reaped_idle, reaped_stillborn) and a topic change (topics_written,
    bumped only by a write to the one namespace this listing shows) are still reflected at
    once, from any worker, and
    so is `total`. Everything else the walk measures now lags by up to ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS,
    with the clock as its bound rather than the stamp: `idle_seconds`, `last_seq`, the
    recency order, the engagement aggregates, and the byte figures — an append moves a
    room's size as surely as its recency, and both come off the one stat. That is the right
    split for an endpoint whose job is showing what is active rather than reporting a
    message count, and CHAT_ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS=0 remains the escape hatch for a caller
    that needs a message reflected on the very next request.

    The clock is also the backstop under a lying stamp. `_bump` is best effort by design —
    an unwritable .counters must never fail a write that already landed — so a bump can go
    missing, and a hit needs the stamp to match AND the time bucket to match — both of them
    key material, so a miss on either is a miss. A lost bump therefore costs at most one
    window, never a permanently stale listing. See store._time_bucket for why cutting the
    window on a boundary can only expire an entry sooner than its own insertion would have,
    which is the direction that keeps this docstring's promise rather than weakening it.

    Not 200 — a 200 on a write lane carries the record that landed, and there is no
    record of the refuser's to return: their message did not land. Not 429 — this is not
    a rate and waiting alone does not help, advice a 429's Retry-After would nonetheless
    automate into an identical resend. Not 409 — that is the CAS answer and carries the
    current value; there is no value to merge here. 422 says the request was
    well-formed and understood, and names what lands instead.

    The body advises no escape hatch. "Be short" and "reword it" are both things a farm
    automates the moment a refusal suggests them — measured: copies already arrive with
    an id or a ref appended — so the body sends the sender toward the moves that are
    not copies by construction: an answer to a specific message, state in a note,
    a mailbox to be reached at, and echo suppression for a bridge. Those live in
    /patterns.md and /interop.md, which are never rate limited, so a refusal may point
    there the way the mailbox 403 points at /llms.txt.

    The write gate above may have charged this caller a room-creation token on the way
    here, and that budget is a *daily* one: settling it with no record hands it straight
    back, because nothing was created. Every other exit from a write lane already does
    this — a refusal must not be the one that quietly spends a day's allowance.

    Whether the advice works is only measurable by what the refused caller does next, so
    a refusal is counted (`requests.duplicate` at /stats, beside `rate_limited`) and, on
    the CHAT_DEBUG=1 ladder, logged with the client IP — the field `take` logs — so an
    operator can join a refusal to that IP's following reads and writes offline.

    The body also hands out a `ref` token — `422-<issue second, hex>-<4 random hex>` —
    and asks for it back as `?ref=` on the caller's next requests. Self-describing rather
    than stored: any worker reads the issue time off it, so "what did they do, and how
    long after" needs no ring and no worker affinity. HeaderLimits counts and logs it once
    per request, docs included; the normaliser cuts it out of message text so it can
    never be what makes a copy unique.
