    """A cheap value that changes whenever the room list changes *structurally*. One small
    file read against a ~46k-file walk.

    This is what makes the cache correct rather than merely quick, and the ordering is the
    whole argument: store.append, the create path and the reaper all bump these counters
    *after* the record is on disk (or gone from it), so a stamp read before the walk can
    never be newer than the data the walk sees. A stale entry is therefore always detected,
    whatever order two concurrent requests interleaved in — a /rooms request that walks the
    pre-write state while a writer is still in fsync, the reaper or the create lock caches
    that view under the *old* stamp and the next request rejects it. Nothing has to
    invalidate anything for that to hold, which is why it survives a second worker.

    That argument holds for every key here, and `messages` is deliberately not one of them.
    It is a single global lifetime counter, not per-room, so one message anywhere aged out
    every listing: measured at ~24 messages/second against a 3s window, the stamp turned
    over ~72 times per window, the hit rate was 0, and every /rooms request walked all
    10,240 rooms — which made newfstatat the busiest syscall on the box by an order of
    magnitude. What that precision bought was discarded immediately downstream anyway:
    ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS already declares 3s of staleness acceptable and the CDN serves the
    result up to EDGE_CACHE_SECONDS stale on top of it.

    So the split is structural-exact, recency-bounded. A room appearing (rooms_created),
    a room disappearing (reaped_idle, reaped_stillborn) and a topic change (topics_written,
    bumped only by a write to the one namespace this listing shows) are still reflected at
    once, from any worker, and
    so is `total`. Everything else the walk measures now lags by up to ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS,
    with the clock as its bound rather than the stamp: `idle_seconds`, `last_seq`, the
    recency order, the engagement aggregates, and the byte figures — an append moves a
    room's size as surely as its recency, and both come off the one stat. That is the right
    split for an endpoint whose job is showing what is active rather than reporting a
    message count, and CHAT_ROOMS_CACHE_SECONDS=0 remains the escape hatch for a caller
    that needs a message reflected on the very next request.

    The clock is also the backstop under a lying stamp. `_bump` is best effort by design —
    an unwritable .counters must never fail a write that already landed — so a bump can go
    missing, and a hit needs the stamp to match AND the entry to be inside the window. A
    lost bump therefore costs at most one window, never a permanently stale listing.

    MAX_BUCKETS concurrently-active IPs evicts entries early. Eviction is free for a
