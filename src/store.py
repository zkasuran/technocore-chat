"""Filesystem-backed append-only store for rooms (chat) and notes (KV).

Design constraints (see docs/design.md):
  - one directory tree, no database, no auth
  - rooms are append-only JSONL files, bounded by a sliding window
  - reads never load the whole file: backwards chunked tail only
  - all caller-supplied names pass an allowlist regex, so no path is ever

# Disk is the only unbounded cost on a world-writable service: MAX_ROOM_BYTES caps each
# room, but nothing capped how many rooms a stranger may create. The first answer was to
# bound the count and read the disk figure off the product, MAX_ROOMS * MAX_ROOM_BYTES.
# That works exactly once. It ties the number of conversations the service will hold to
# the size of the volume, so the count cannot grow without the bill growing with it: at
# the 5120 below the product is 51 GiB, a volume nobody provisions for a worst case that
# needs an attacker to fill every ring to the brim. So the two are now separate constants
# with separate jobs, and both are enforced (see `_check_room_capacity`).
#
# MAX_ROOMS bounds how many rooms the service *tracks* — the directory walks, the reaper,
# the overview — not the disk.
MAX_ROOMS = config.MAX_ROOMS
# MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES is the disk budget, stated rather than derived, and it is
# deliberately the OLD product (512 * 10 MiB): ten times the rooms cost exactly the same
# volume as before, because what filled the old cap was thousands of small rooms and not
# hundreds of full ones. This is the number a deployment sizes its volume against.
# Raising it, or MAX_ROOM_BYTES, is what needs re-checking against the volume now —
# raising MAX_ROOMS no longer does.
MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES = 5 << 30
# The budget above is only a real bound if rooms cannot grow past it after they are made.
# Gating *creation* alone does not do that: 5120 rooms created while usage is low can each
# then grow to MAX_ROOM_BYTES, which is 51 GiB — ten times the number the operator was told
# to provision. So the ring itself yields under pressure. Every room is guaranteed this
# much; above it a room keeps up to MAX_ROOM_BYTES only while the service has headroom, and
# compacts back to its guaranteed floor on the next append once the budget is spent.
#
# That is what closes the hole, because growing a room *requires appending to it*: the
# write that would push a room past its floor is the same write that compacts it. Rooms
# already large when the budget is reached stay large until they are written to or reaped,
# but they were counted in the budget that triggered this, so the total does not climb.
# Overshoot is one refresh interval of writes, and writes are rate limited.
#
# = MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES // MAX_ROOMS on purpose: the floor times the cap is the budget, so
# even the worst case — every room at its floor — lands exactly on the number.
RESERVED_ROOM_BYTES = MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES // MAX_ROOMS
# How many rooms exist and how many bytes they occupy — "count bytes", the same two-integer
# format and the same machinery as NOTES_FILE below, so one atomic replace keeps both halves
# describing the same store.
#
# The byte half is what this file always held: a cached figure and not a live walk, because
# it is read on the append path where a per-write walk of every room would cost more than the
# thing it is protecting. The reaper already walks the tree on a timer, so refreshing it there
# is free, and a stale-by-one-interval number is fine for a bound whose overshoot is bounded
# by the rate limiter anyway.
#
# The count half is new and is what retires the global create gate (#578). `_check_room_capacity`
# used to answer MAX_ROOMS with a live sized walk of every bucket — ~16 ms per new room, run
# under a service-wide flock that also spanned the append, the fsync and any compaction, which
# is what made room creation globally serial at a measured 229 ms per flock. Reading a count
# instead makes the check O(1), so the only thing left to serialise is the counter's own
# read-modify-write: two small file operations, held for microseconds.
#
# What that trades away is exactness, deliberately and with the same fail-closed doctrine
# NOTES_FILE already documents. The reservation moves before the file is created, so a crash in
# between over-counts and refuses a create that was allowed. The reaper's own rewrite
# (`_settle_count`) is a walk that cannot see a reservation whose file has not landed yet, so
# it adds back whatever this file grew by while it walked: the figure lands high by at most the
# creates that landed during that pass, once per REAP_EVERY, and the next pass re-establishes
# it. The resulting overshoot on MAX_ROOMS is bounded by those creates and does not accumulate:
# every subsequent check reads the higher figure and refuses. Rooms can afford that where notes
# cannot, because MAX_ROOMS bounds the walks and the *byte* budget bounds the disk — and a room
# is created empty, so an overshoot of N rooms is N sidecar locks of disk, not N rings.
USAGE_FILE = ".usage"
# How many notes exist and how many bytes they occupy, so neither the global note cap nor
# the /rooms gauge walks every namespace — the same trade USAGE_FILE already makes for room
# bytes. Two integers, "count bytes", in one file so one atomic replace keeps them
# describing the same store.
#
# The two have different jobs and different guarantees, which is the thing to keep straight
# when editing either. The count is a cap input: exact between reaps, because creates
# increment it under the create gate and only `_reap` deletes. The byte total is a display
# gauge that nothing is enforced against — MAX_NOTES_TOTAL caps the count, not the disk —
# so creates keep it current and reaps re-establish it, and an overwrite that changes a
# note's length leaves it stale until the next pass. Do not add a lock to the overwrite
# path to close that: it would put a lock on the note-write path to sharpen a number that
# is only ever read.
#
# `_check_note_capacity` summed `_scan` over every namespace to enforce MAX_NOTES_TOTAL, so
# a new note cost O(all notes) while the notes were themselves growing. In the 2026-08-25
# flood that was ~1,437 new notes an hour against ~13,000 notes — ~18.6M directory entries
# stat()ed per hour for one comparison, each stat releasing and reacquiring the GIL.
#
# Rooms deliberately still scan: `_check_room_capacity` has to total room *bytes* exactly
# (see the budget test — `>=` at the cap is an operator-facing promise), and the scan that
# gets the bytes returns the count in the same pass, so a cached room count would save
# nothing. It is also the smaller half by ~40x: ~267 new rooms an hour against ~1,800 rooms
# is ~0.5M entries, where the notes were ~18.6M. Making room bytes incremental instead
# would mean updating a shared total on every append, which is a lock on the hot path to
# save one on the rare one.
#
# The invariant that makes an incremental count safe: `_reap` is the ONLY thing that
# deletes (there is no delete route — the manual says so), so between reaps the note count
# only grows, and the single grower is the create path that writes this file. `_reap` then
# rewrites the figure by totalling the walk it already makes, so drift is bounded by
# REAP_EVERY and self-heals. Being the only deleter makes that walk exact against *deletions*
# and nothing else; a create counted but not yet written is invisible to it. Rather than hold
# the creates still for the length of a walk that now costs half a minute, the pass reads this
# file with the creates waited out at both ends and adds back what it grew by in between —
# fail-closed by construction, at the price of running high by however many of that pass's
# creates the walk happened to see (`_counted_at` and `_settle_count` carry the arithmetic,
# and `_reap` runs one pass at a time so the window is a window).
#
# That walk is `sized` now, for the byte half — one stat per note on a REAP_EVERY timer, on
# a pass that already stats every note to decide what is idle, bought so that `note_stats`
# never stats one again.
#
# Fail-closed three ways. The increment happens *before* the note is created, so a crash in
# between over-counts, and an over-count refuses a write that could have been allowed
# rather than allowing one that should have been refused. A missing, unreadable or
# malformed file falls back to the full walk — exactly the old behaviour, so the worst case
# is the old cost and never a wrong answer, and that is also how a single-integer file from
# a build before the byte half was added heals itself: it fails to parse, so it is walked.
# And it is read under this file's own lock, which a create holds while it reserves, so the check
# and the increment cannot interleave.
#
# What it does not survive: an unclean shutdown under CHAT_FSYNC=0 can lose the last write,
# leaving the count stale until the next reap (<= REAP_EVERY). Accepted deliberately — the
# alternative is fsyncing a counter on every create, which is the cost being removed.
NOTES_FILE = ".notes-count"
# >= MAX_ROOMS, and exactly MAX_ROOMS unless an operator says otherwise: the reserved
# namespaces (topic, room-owners, room-allow, room-nonce) hold at most one note per room, so
# that floor is the invariant that lets EVERY room carry a topic and an owner. Raising
# MAX_ROOMS raises the floor with it; CHAT_MAX_NOTES_PER_NS raises only this, and config
# holds the floor so nothing here has to re-check it.
#
# Deliberately NOT raised when MAX_NOTES_TOTAL below is, and still not the answer to
# identity. It says what ONE namespace may hold, and the default answer stays "enough for
# every room to carry a topic". Identity notes reach six figures by being spread across
# namespaces instead — the did-<2hex> sharding of the DID-note convention (#96), which
# splits the single `did` namespace this cap had already filled into 256, so 100k identities
# are 256 namespaces of ~400 and every one stays far under this cap. Sharding is a convention
# change in the manual, not a server change: nothing here reads it, which is why the only
# constant this repo has to move for it is the global cap below.
#
# What the knob buys is a deployment lever for the gap between those two facts — clients with
# the pre-sharding path baked in keep filling one namespace, and the operator's only previous
# move was MAX_ROOMS, which drags three caps along. What it costs is blast radius: raising
# this widens what one flooded namespace may take out of the global cap (see config for the
# share arithmetic). An instance that sets nothing keeps today's bound exactly.
MAX_NOTES_PER_NS = config.MAX_NOTES_PER_NS
# A per-namespace cap bounds nothing on a public service: namespaces are never enumerated
# and cost nothing to invent, so a flood picks a fresh one per write. The global cap is the
# one that holds, and it bounds namespace directories too because a namespace only exists
# once a note in it was accepted.
#
# A knob (CHAT_MAX_NOTES_TOTAL) whose DEFAULT is derived from MAX_ROOMS, because the two are
# not independent at the bottom: the four reserved namespaces hold one note per room each, so
# anything below 4 * MAX_ROOMS makes the MAX_NOTES_PER_NS invariant above a lie — the global
# cap would run out before every room could carry a topic and an owner. That floor is
# enforced in config and is the part of this that is not the operator's to choose; what sits
# above it is. Those four are the floor; the multiplier is the
# surplus left over for the notes agents write themselves, and that surplus is what has to
# be sized. 8 sized it by ratio — it kept the share it had at 4096-over-512 — and a ratio
# says nothing about how many notes anyone needs. 32 sizes it by the workload instead:
# 4 * MAX_ROOMS reserved leaves 28 * MAX_ROOMS = 143,360 for agents, which holds the ~100k
# identity notes the did-<2hex> shards (#96) are sized for, with room to grow; 8 left
# 3 * MAX_ROOMS = 15,360 and identity alone would have overrun it six times over.
#
# Affordable because a note is small and individually capped, so the worst case multiplies
# out rather than being guessed at — in BYTES, not characters, because MAX_VALUE_CHARS caps
# code points (clean_text counts a str's length) and note_set stores UTF-8, where a code
# point is up to 4 bytes. A note of 8,192 four-byte characters is 32 KiB on disk, so the
# hostile ceiling is 163,840 * 32 KiB = 5 GiB — equal to MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES, which makes
# the volume worst case rooms + notes = 10 GiB. All-ASCII notes (which is what identity
# notes are) put the same count at 1.25 GiB. Before this raise the same arithmetic gave a
# 1.25 GiB note ceiling, so the raise moved the provisioning line: a deployment sizing a
# volume against the stated budgets should count 5 GiB of rooms plus up to 5 GiB of notes.
#
# Capping stored *bytes* instead would pin the ceiling at 1.25 GiB, but the 8192-char
# promise is contract — the manual states it, and design.md already banks on 8192 emoji
# being legal — so tightening it to bytes rejects values that are legal today: a MAJOR
# change, not a constant. The count cap plus the per-value char cap is what bounds disk.
#
# Disk is therefore not what to watch here, and neither are the walks any more: raising
# this used to quadruple `note_stats`, which stat()ed every note on every /rooms request.
# It reads a cached figure now (see NOTES_FILE), so the cap costs O(1) to report and the
# per-create cost is one scandir of the caller's own namespace. Growing this is a disk
# decision again, which is what the arithmetic above is for — and now the disk decision an
# operator can take on its own, without moving the room cap to reach it (config).

# whole digest IS the component: no slice, no mask, and nothing computed and thrown away.
#
# 256 and not 65,536, because the two are not the same trade at this store's shape. What
# sharding has to fix is one enormous directory — a namespace at the per-namespace cap is
# 200,000 entries counting sidecar locks, and that is what every create in it scans. 256
# buckets cut that to ~780, which readdir does not care about. Two levels cut it to ~4 and
# cost ~840,000 directories to do it, because ~1,000 of this store's namespaces hold five
# notes or fewer and each one still pays for its own bucket tree: measured against the live
# distribution, two levels put MORE directories under notes/ than there are notes. 512 was
# measured too (a 9-bit mask, unbiased since 512 divides 65536) and halves an already-small
# bucket for twice the directories. See bench/shard.py.
#
# This function is an on-disk format: changing the width or the hash puts every existing file
# in the wrong bucket. The dual read below makes that survivable — a re-shard is the same
# lazy migration this one is — but it is not free, so it is frozen deliberately here.
#
# Unkeyed, deliberately. Bucket membership is derivable by anyone who can run blake2b, so the
# layout leaks nothing the name does not: an unlisted `p-` room is a capability URL whose
# secret is the entropy in the name itself (see `unlisted`), never where the file sits, and a
# secret that guarded only the directory would be protecting a fact the room name already
# gives away. `key` stays on the signature so an instance that ever wants per-deployment
# buckets has the hook — it is a blake2b keyword, passed straight through.
#
# Memoized because the resolver is on every read path and the answer is a pure function of
# the string: 350 ns of hashing becomes a 36 ns cache hit, which is how the whole resolution
# lands under the budget rather than over it. Sized like `_listable`, and for the same reason
# — names are caller-supplied, so a flood of fresh ones must cost misses and never memory.

    can create and flock that very path, and the replace then unlinks the inode it is holding.
    The next writer opens the inode that arrived instead, so two workers hold what both
    believe is the room lock — and `seq` is assigned under it, as are the nonce check and CAS.
    Reproduced before it was removed: a third opener took the lock while the second still held
    it. There is no check-then-replace that closes this; not replacing is what closes it.

    Nothing is lost by leaving the stray, because nothing can be holding it. `_locked` is only
    ever called on a path `_resolve` handed out, and `_resolve` hands out the legacy path only
    while the file is still there — so the lock a live writer holds is always the one beside
    the file it is writing. `_sweep_orphan_locks` already exists for precisely this shape (a
    lock whose data file is gone) and reclaims it once it has been idle as long as any reaped
    room.

    The reaper is the one caller that can hold a legacy lock, because it locks what its walk

    The property that matters is that every caller gets the SAME answer, not that the answer
    is always the bucket. A resolver handing the legacy path to readers and the bucket to
    writers forks a live room in two — the old file keeps the history, the new one restarts at
    `seq` 1, and reads see only the new one because they check the bucket first. So this
    returns one path per name per instant, and it is the file that actually exists.

    Which is why a migration that could not run falls back to the legacy path rather than
    returning a bucket with nothing in it. A read-only volume, or a restore whose ownership
    was never fixed, would otherwise turn every unmigrated room into an empty one and every
    note into a missing one — silently, because an absent file is how this store spells "no
    such room". Serving the data that is plainly there is strictly better than hiding it, and
    it is not the fork above: readers and writers still agree, since the fallback is only
    taken while the legacy file is the only copy in existence.

    Two resolvers racing the same unmigrated name both reach `_migrate`; the first
    `os.replace` wins, the second fails ENOENT on a source already gone, and both then see the
    legacy file absent and return the same bucketed path.

    Best effort, exactly like `_log_event`: the caller's write has already succeeded by

    error. The cost of that choice is a possible undercount, which is the right way round
    — a digest that reports slightly low is recoverable, a write that 500s is not.

    Two things keep it cheap, and they are separate. The rule above decides whether to
    write at all; LOCK_NB decides what happens when the write cannot get the lock.

    That contract is what pays for LOCK_NB here. Every append in the service ran through
    this one lock and *waited* on it, so writes to unrelated rooms serialised behind each
    other on a counter neither of them reads (#588). Now a writer that finds the lock held
    leaves its delta in `_PENDING` and returns; the next writer that does get the lock
    persists the whole accumulated batch in the same single read-modify-replace one bump
    used to cost. Uncontended — one process, no overlap — that is still a write per bump,
    exactly as before, so nothing about a quiet store changes.

    The batch is taken out of `_PENDING` only *after* the flock is held, so a caller that
    cannot get the lock never removes deltas another thread is counting on, and there is
    never a moment where a batch is out of the bucket and no one holds the lock to persist
    it. A replace that fails hands the batch back rather than dropping it, and the
    successful path never reaches that handler, so a batch cannot be applied twice.

    What it costs: `.counters` lags by whatever is pending while the lock is contended
    (bounded by one holder's read-modify-replace, and caught up by the next bump), and a
    worker killed hard loses its own unflushed batch — hard specifically, since app.py's
    lifespan flushes this bucket on a graceful stop, which is what a rolling deploy sends. Both are the undercount this

    round trip through the same encoder — is a way to corrupt proofs, not a formatting

    snapshot rather than a torn record inside it. An `e-` room's expired prefix is outside
    it too (`_export_start`): expiry is drop-on-read, and export is a read.

    note namespace *are* bearer credentials (see `unlisted`), so a digest that carried them
    would hand write access to every reader of wherever the digest lands, and to whatever
    retains it. Counts of those same things are safe and are what an operator actually
    watches, so counts are what this returns.

    Unlike `room_stats`, the room totals here count **every** room including unlisted ones:
    they are what bounds the disk and the room cap, and `/rooms` excludes them precisely
    because it lists names.

    The count and the byte total are the maintained ones — the same two integers the room
    cap is enforced against, so the gauge and the refusal cannot disagree, and the walk
    below no longer stats what one file already says. That stat was 71% of this pass at
    the live size (238,983 rooms: 3.26 s with it, 0.94 s without). What is left is a
    readdir for the class decomposition, which needs the names; it is still O(rooms), and
    the engagement rollup's own walk still stats every room -- see #576, which proposes the
    recency index that would retire both.

    The byte half is measured only when no reap has settled it yet (`_count_new_room`
    carries it through untouched, so a store reaps into it). Reading 0 as "no pressure" is
    right on the append path, where the figure gates a compaction and failing open costs
    one reap interval; here it is the gauge itself, and a fresh store that reported zero
    bytes against rooms it can see would be reporting something it knows to be false. That
    walk is the one this pass just dropped, so it is bounded by the same thing that bounds
    an unreaped store: appends run reaps.

      - **The first split.** No backup yet, so every entry in the map predates this pass, and
        anything already in a shard was put there by `_set_seq_entry` while this ran. The shard
        wins.
      - **A map that came back.** The backup exists, so this map was written *after* a split
        had already consumed and renamed the original — which only an old worker still running
        the pre-shard code does, during a rolling upgrade. Its entry is then the newer fact and
        the shard's is stale, so the map wins. Getting this backwards silently drops that
        worker's reap or create: the room's floor regresses and cursors past it miss messages,
        or a generation bump is lost and a stateful reader is told nothing changed.

    The recovered map is unlinked rather than renamed, so the backup keeps holding the *whole*
    pre-shard state. Overwriting it with the handful of entries a mixed-version window produced
    would leave a downgrade reading a map that had lost almost every room it once knew.

    The old file is renamed, never deleted — `.seqstate.pre-shard`, which the `??` glob the
    sweep below uses cannot match. A downgrade puts the old code back in front of a map it
    still understands, so this is the one step of the change that is not self-reversing and
    it costs a rename to keep it that way. An operator who has finished with it can remove it.

    Best effort and idempotent: a failure leaves the map in place, `_seq_entry` keeps reading
    it as the fallback, and the next reap tries again. Runs once in the life of a store — and

    that looked right. Read before the walk as well and that is a mismatch, K-1 against K.

    What the third point buys, stated as what it does not buy. Agreement everywhere means the
    file ended the pass where it started, so nothing landed during it but creates already
    reserved at the before-read, and the walk cannot have counted more notes than the file
    claimed at that moment. An over-high file therefore never agrees, and a namespace this
    pass deleted in is in `dirs` and visited whatever its count says. A low file agrees only
    by borrowing a reservation in flight at that first read — one that has moved the file and
    not yet written its note — and then only if the walk misses exactly that note: an
    undercount of one, surviving one pass. Reading with the creates waited out would close
    that, and would mean holding the span across a read of every namespace, which is the hold
    this branch exists to remove. It clears on any later pass whose reading does not land
    inside a create, and MAX_NOTES_PER_NS is all it can over-admit against in between.

    The unlink is under the span, exclusively, and needs it every bit as much as the rmdir
    below does. Unlocked it puts a count *below* its notes: create 1 has reserved
    (`_count_new_note` wrote K+1) and is still writing its note when the file goes; create 2
    finds nothing to read, rebuilds by walking a namespace whose K+1'th note is not on disk
    yet, persists K, and reserves K+1 against it. Two notes were made, the file moved by one,
    and the namespace over-admits against MAX_NOTES_PER_NS until something rewrites the
    figure. Both creates hold the span shared, so only an exclusive holder is waited out for.

    A create landing mid-pass shows up as a mismatch that heals nothing. It costs one unlink
    and one rebuild scan by that namespace's next create — which is what every namespace paid
    on every pass when the drop was unconditional, and that version took this span once per
    namespace: 10,114 exclusive acquisitions of the lock every note create holds shared, the
    single largest holder of blocked time in the production profile. In steady state this set
    is empty or a handful.

    The rmdir visits `dirs` alone — the namespaces this pass deleted a note in or swept a lock
    in. It runs after `_sweep_orphan_locks`, which is what puts a namespace back to notes and
    locks only and so lets the rmdir reach an emptied one, and which reports what it emptied
    into the same set, so a namespace drained by an earlier pass is still reached. One left
    empty by neither a deletion nor a lock (a crash in the mkdir-to-open gap makes one) is not
    removed; it costs one directory entry and the next create there moves back into it.

    That half wants the span for a nearer reason than the count's. A create makes its
    namespace directory inside `_locked`, one `mkdir` before the `open` that creates the
    sidecar lock in it, and the directory is still empty in between — precisely what this
    rmdir looks for. Removing it in that gap does not merely lose a race, it fails the create:
    creating a file in a directory being removed is EINVAL on APFS, measured here and needing
    O_CREAT to reproduce at all, where a directory merely *gone* gives the ENOENT POSIX
    specifies — the errno this was expected to be and never was. Either way the note write
    dies on a path it had just made. A create holds that span shared across the whole of its
    reservation and write (see `_create_gate`), so waiting for it exclusively is waiting for
    exactly the gap to close.

    Per namespace rather than once around the loop: a create only ever needs the directory it
    is entering to stand still, so holding the span across all of them would queue creates
    behind namespaces they have nothing to do with. Inside the `try` for the reason this whole
    tail is best effort — `_reap` runs on the request path, and a pass that cannot take the
    span must skip a cleanup, never fail the create that triggered it.

    this service still has no background thread, no scheduler and no lifespan hook — the
    two periodic jobs are both "whoever writes next, if it is due". The cost is one extra
    directory walk per interval on a path that is already walking those directories to

    the reader assuming a fixed cadence.

    at once, measured), only to find the marker fresh when it got in. Unlike `_reap` nothing

    build one at the point of action, which for the reaper means the branch that actually
    unlinks — a live pass finds 0 reapable files, so the old shape built ~207,000 Paths to
    act on none of them.

    Note the asymmetry with `_scan`, which is faster still on the same directories: it only
    ever counts and measures, so it never needs the entry after the loop body. Use that one
    where a count is all you need.

    Depth-agnostic rather than the old `nested` switch, which said "exactly one level down"
    and so could only ever be right about one layout. Under sharding a room is one level
    deeper and a note two, and during the lazy migration BOTH depths are occupied at once —
    a walk that picked a number would miss every file that had not moved yet, which for the
    reaper means idle files never reaped and for the sweeper means locks never swept.

    """Hold the write lock on `path`, and — for a *create* — check a cap and reserve against
    it under a second lock held only for that.

    A per-file lock cannot enforce a cap over other files: two concurrent creates of
    different names each pass their own lock, each count `cap - 1`, and both write, so the
    cap is overshot by up to one write per in-flight request. What closes that is that the
    count a create is checked against and the count it consumes move together, with nothing
    in between — not that the *creation* is serialised too. Separating those two is #578.

    `gate` used to be a service-wide create mutex (`.rooms-create`, `.notes-create`) held
    across the whole body: the capacity walk, the append, its fsync and any compaction. Room
    and note creation therefore had a global concurrency of one across every worker, measured
    in production at 229 ms per flock with every AnyIO thread parked in it — once room
    creation turned out to be a high-rate ongoing operation rather than the rare event the
    old docstring assumed (~90k rooms created against ~49k live, because the reaper keeps
    freeing slots). `gate` is the *counter file* now — USAGE_FILE for rooms, NOTES_FILE for
    notes — read by `check` and written by `counted`, and it is released before the body
    runs. What stays serialised across the store is two small file operations. `check` and
    `counted` are called holding it and must not take it again.

    Three locks, each for one job, taken in this order everywhere:

      - `<gate>.create`, SHARED, spanning the whole create. It is never contended by another
        create; it exists so the reaper can take it exclusively and know that no create is
        between its reservation and its write. `_counted_at` and `_settle_count` need that to
        bound the creates their walk could not see; `_prune` and `_drop_emptied_namespaces`
        need it because `_locked` below makes a directory one `mkdir` before opening the
        sidecar lock inside it, and removing it in that gap fails the write outright (ENOENT,
        or EINVAL on APFS) rather than merely losing a race; and the same drop needs it to
        unlink a per-namespace count, which between a create's reservation and its write would
        be dropping a figure that create has already moved.
        The reaper takes it for two file operations at each end of its pass and never
        across the walk between them: a hold that long parks every create in the store.
      - `path`'s own sidecar lock, which the body would take anyway, taken *before* the
        counter so that "does this file exist" is a settled question for the name being
        created. That is what keeps two racers on ONE name counting one note: the loser
        blocks here, and by the time it looks the file is there, so it reserves nothing.
      - `gate` itself, exclusive, for exactly `check` + `counted(1)`.

    `check` therefore runs twice, and the first one is not redundant: taking `path`'s lock
    *creates* it, and its bucket with it, so a store at its cap would spend an inode per
    rejection — which is not a cap. The early call refuses before anything is made. It reads
    counters and never persists a zero, so it creates nothing itself. The one inside the locks
    stays the authoritative answer.

    `counted` is a reservation, so it takes a sign: the count moves before the write and
    moves back if the write does not happen. Both halves are needed and neither is the
    crash window the ordering below is about.

      - The body can refuse *after* the gate has counted. `?if=<value>` against a key that
        does not exist reaches its CAS check inside the body and raises, so a caller
        repeating one against fresh keys used to add a note to the totals every time while
        creating none — cheap for them, since a refusal writes nothing, and enough to walk
        a namespace to MAX_NOTES_PER_NS and lock it out until the next reap.
      - The file can be created by somebody else *while we wait for the locks*. The waiter
        then holds them over an overwrite, not a create, so it must not count either — hence
        the second `path.exists()`, which is not the one above it: that one runs before the

    signature. `GET /r/<room>` shares the reader's budget and could not reach that far back,
    which is why the duplicate showed up in the export rather than on the page. The window was
    attacker-controlled too, since flooding the room is how you close it and writes are the
    cheap operation here.

    The ring stays the bound, so no state outlives the messages it guards. Once a record leaves
    the room a replay is accepted again as a fresh message, which is the retention model doing
    what it says. What changes is that "still in the room" now means retained, which is what
    the export serves, rather than inside a tail a reader happens to share.

    Cost: the wider scan only reads to the end when this DID has no record in the room. The
    pre-filter already guarding it (the comment below) keeps that affordable: a DID is a
    56-character ASCII string, so `did_b not in raw` rules a line out at C speed before `_parse`
    runs; only a real record from this key is parsed. The common case is unchanged: the scan
    runs newest-first and returns at this key's first record, so a signer who wrote recently
    never reads deeper than before, while a room only reaches the full ring under sustained
    flooding. Both are on the write path of a lane that already verifies an Ed25519 signature.

    never enumerated. A per-namespace breakdown would enumerate precisely what must stay
    unenumerable, so this returns a count and a byte total: enough to watch the capacity
    that bounds the disk, useless for discovering anyone's notes.

    Two file reads, not a walk. This used to scan every namespace and stat every note on
    each call: 124 ms at the old 40960 cap, 480 ms at 163840 (tmpfs; a real disk is worse),
    which made it far and away the most expensive thing /rooms did. app.py caches it, but

    write — the walk ran per request exactly when the store was least able to afford it,
    and raising the cap to 32 * MAX_ROOMS would have made that 4x worse.

    So both numbers now come from the totals the create path and the reaper already
    maintain (see NOTES_FILE), and the cost stopped scaling with the store at all.

    `total` is the same number the cap is enforced against, which is a second reason to
    read it here: the gauge and the refusal can no longer disagree, where a walk and a
    cached count could. `bytes` is the looser of the two — creates keep it current and a
    reap re-establishes it, so an overwrite that changes a note's length leaves it stale
    for at most REAP_EVERY. That is the same trade room bytes make (see USAGE_FILE), and
    it is the right one here because nothing enforces this number: MAX_NOTES_TOTAL is a
    count cap, so the byte total is a gauge an operator reads, never a bound a write is
