# Disk is the only unbounded cost on a world-writable service: MAX_ROOM_BYTES caps each
# room, but nothing capped how many rooms a stranger may create. The first answer was to
# bound the count and read the disk figure off the product, MAX_ROOMS * MAX_ROOM_BYTES.
# That works exactly once. It ties the number of conversations the service will hold to
# the size of the volume, so the count cannot grow without the bill growing with it: at
# the 5120 below the product is 50 GiB, a volume nobody provisions for a worst case that
# needs an attacker to fill every ring to the brim. So the two are now separate constants
# with separate jobs, and both are enforced (see `_check_room_capacity`).
#
# MAX_ROOMS bounds how many rooms the service *tracks* — the directory walks, the reaper,
# the overview — not the disk.
MAX_ROOMS = config.MAX_ROOMS
# MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES is the disk budget, stated rather than derived, and it is
# deliberately the OLD product (512 * 10 MiB): ten times the rooms cost exactly the same
# volume as before, because what filled the old cap was thousands of small rooms and not
# hundreds of full ones. This is the number a deployment sizes its volume against.
# Raising it, or MAX_ROOM_BYTES, is what needs re-checking against the volume now —
# raising MAX_ROOMS no longer does.
MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES = 5 << 30
# The budget above is only a real bound if rooms cannot grow past it after they are made.
# Gating *creation* alone does not do that: 5120 rooms created while usage is low can each
# then grow to MAX_ROOM_BYTES, which is 50 GiB — ten times the number the operator was told
# to provision. So the ring itself yields under pressure. Every room is guaranteed this
# much; above it a room keeps up to MAX_ROOM_BYTES only while the service has headroom, and
# compacts back to its guaranteed floor on the next append once the budget is spent.
#
# That is what closes the hole, because growing a room *requires appending to it*: the
# write that would push a room past its floor is the same write that compacts it. Rooms
# already large when the budget is reached stay large until they are written to or reaped,
# but they were counted in the budget that triggered this, so the total does not climb.
# Overshoot is one refresh interval of writes, and writes are rate limited.
#

# Total room bytes as of the last reap pass. A cached figure and not a live walk: this is
# read on the append path, where a per-write walk of every room would cost more than the
# thing it is protecting. The reaper already walks the tree on a timer, so refreshing it
# there is free, and a stale-by-one-interval number is fine for a bound whose overshoot is
# bounded by the rate limiter anyway.
USAGE_FILE = ".usage"
# How many notes exist and how many bytes they occupy, so neither the global note cap nor
# the /rooms gauge walks every namespace — the same trade USAGE_FILE already makes for room
# bytes. Two integers, "count bytes", in one file so one atomic replace keeps them
# describing the same store.
#
# The two have different jobs and different guarantees, which is the thing to keep straight
# when editing either. The count is a cap input: exact between reaps, because creates
# increment it under the create gate and only `_reap` deletes. The byte total is a display
# gauge that nothing is enforced against — MAX_NOTES_TOTAL caps the count, not the disk —
# so creates keep it current and reaps re-establish it, and an overwrite that changes a
# note's length leaves it stale until the next pass. Do not add a lock to the overwrite
# path to close that: it would put a lock on the note-write path to sharpen a number that
# is only ever read.
#
# `_check_note_capacity` summed `_scan` over every namespace to enforce MAX_NOTES_TOTAL, so
# a new note cost O(all notes) while the notes were themselves growing. In the 2026-08-25
# flood that was ~1,437 new notes an hour against ~13,000 notes — ~18.6M directory entries
# stat()ed per hour for one comparison, each stat releasing and reacquiring the GIL.
#
# Rooms deliberately still scan: `_check_room_capacity` has to total room *bytes* exactly
# (see the budget test — `>=` at the cap is an operator-facing promise), and the scan that
# gets the bytes returns the count in the same pass, so a cached room count would save
# nothing. It is also the smaller half by ~40x: ~267 new rooms an hour against ~1,800 rooms
# is ~0.5M entries, where the notes were ~18.6M. Making room bytes incremental instead
# would mean updating a shared total on every append, which is a lock on the hot path to
# save one on the rare one.
#
# The invariant that makes an incremental count safe: `_reap` is the ONLY thing that
# deletes (there is no delete route — the manual says so), so between reaps the note count
# only grows, and the single grower is the create path that writes this file. `_reap` then
# rewrites the exact figure from a walk it already makes, so drift is bounded by REAP_EVERY
# and self-heals. That rewrite takes `.notes-create` too — being the only deleter makes the
# walk exact against *deletions* and nothing else; a create counted but not yet written is
# invisible to it, so the creates have to be held still for the figure to be true.
#
# That walk is `sized` now, for the byte half — one stat per note on a REAP_EVERY timer, on
# a pass that already stats every note to decide what is idle, bought so that `note_stats`
# never stats one again.
#
# Fail-closed three ways. The increment happens *before* the note is created, so a crash in
# between over-counts, and an over-count refuses a write that could have been allowed
# rather than allowing one that should have been refused. A missing, unreadable or
# malformed file falls back to the full walk — exactly the old behaviour, so the worst case
# is the old cost and never a wrong answer, and that is also how a single-integer file from
# a build before the byte half was added heals itself: it fails to parse, so it is walked.
# And it is read under `.notes-create`, which already serialises note creation, so the check
# and the increment cannot interleave.
#
# What it does not survive: an unclean shutdown under CHAT_FSYNC=0 can lose the last write,
# leaving the count stale until the next reap (<= REAP_EVERY). Accepted deliberately — the
# alternative is fsyncing a counter on every create, which is the cost being removed.
NOTES_FILE = ".notes-count"
# >= MAX_ROOMS, and exactly MAX_ROOMS unless an operator says otherwise: the reserved
# namespaces (topic, room-owners, room-allow, room-nonce) hold at most one note per room, so
# that floor is the invariant that lets EVERY room carry a topic and an owner. Raising
# MAX_ROOMS raises the floor with it; CHAT_MAX_NOTES_PER_NS raises only this, and config
# holds the floor so nothing here has to re-check it.
#
# Deliberately NOT raised when MAX_NOTES_TOTAL below is, and still not the answer to
# identity. It says what ONE namespace may hold, and the default answer stays "enough for
# every room to carry a topic". Identity notes reach six figures by being spread across
# namespaces instead — the did-<2hex> sharding of the DID-note convention (#96), which
# splits the single `did` namespace this cap had already filled into 256, so 100k identities
# are 256 namespaces of ~400 and every one stays far under this cap. Sharding is a convention
# change in the manual, not a server change: nothing here reads it, which is why the only
# constant this repo has to move for it is the global cap below.
#
# What the knob buys is a deployment lever for the gap between those two facts — clients with
# the pre-sharding path baked in keep filling one namespace, and the operator's only previous
# move was MAX_ROOMS, which drags three caps along. What it costs is blast radius: raising
# this widens what one flooded namespace may take out of the global cap (see config for the
# share arithmetic). An instance that sets nothing keeps today's bound exactly.
MAX_NOTES_PER_NS = config.MAX_NOTES_PER_NS
# A per-namespace cap bounds nothing on a public service: namespaces are never enumerated
# and cost nothing to invent, so a flood picks a fresh one per write. The global cap is the
# one that holds, and it bounds namespace directories too because a namespace only exists
# once a note in it was accepted.
#
# Derived from MAX_ROOMS, not a literal, because the two are not independent: the four
# reserved namespaces hold one note per room each, so anything below 4 * MAX_ROOMS makes
# the MAX_NOTES_PER_NS invariant above a lie — the global cap would run out before every
# room could carry a topic and an owner. Those four are the floor; the multiplier is the
# surplus left over for the notes agents write themselves, and that surplus is what has to
# be sized. 8 sized it by ratio — it kept the share it had at 4096-over-512 — and a ratio
# says nothing about how many notes anyone needs. 32 sizes it by the workload instead:
# 4 * MAX_ROOMS reserved leaves 28 * MAX_ROOMS = 143,360 for agents, which holds the ~100k
# identity notes the did-<2hex> shards (#96) are sized for, with room to grow; 8 left
# 3 * MAX_ROOMS = 15,360 and identity alone would have overrun it six times over.
#
# Affordable because a note is small and individually capped, so the worst case multiplies
# out rather than being guessed at — in BYTES, not characters, because MAX_VALUE_CHARS caps
# code points (clean_text counts a str's length) and note_set stores UTF-8, where a code
# point is up to 4 bytes. A note of 8,192 four-byte characters is 32 KiB on disk, so the
# hostile ceiling is 163,840 * 32 KiB = 5 GiB — equal to MAX_TOTAL_ROOM_BYTES, which makes
# the volume worst case rooms + notes = 10 GiB. All-ASCII notes (which is what identity
# notes are) put the same count at 1.25 GiB. Before this raise the same arithmetic gave a
# 1.25 GiB note ceiling, so the raise moved the provisioning line: a deployment sizing a
# volume against the stated budgets should count 5 GiB of rooms plus up to 5 GiB of notes.
#
# Capping stored *bytes* instead would pin the ceiling at 1.25 GiB, but the 8192-char
# promise is contract — the manual states it, and design.md already banks on 8192 emoji
# being legal — so tightening it to bytes rejects values that are legal today: a MAJOR
# change, not a constant. The count cap plus the per-value char cap is what bounds disk.
#
# Disk is therefore not what to watch here, and neither are the walks any more: raising
# this used to quadruple `note_stats`, which stat()ed every note on every /rooms request.
# It reads a cached figure now (see NOTES_FILE), so the cap costs O(1) to report and the
# per-create cost is one scandir of the caller's own namespace. Growing this is a disk
# decision again, which is what the arithmetic above is for.

    Moving the sidecar too looked tidier and was a lock-domain bug. Between testing that the
    destination is free and replacing it, another worker that already sees the migrated data
    can create and flock that very path, and the replace then unlinks the inode it is holding.
    The next writer opens the inode that arrived instead, so two workers hold what both
    believe is the room lock — and `seq` is assigned under it, as are the nonce check and CAS.
    Reproduced before it was removed: a third opener took the lock while the second still held
    it. There is no check-then-replace that closes this; not replacing is what closes it.

    Nothing is lost by leaving the stray, because nothing can be holding it. `_locked` is only
    ever called on a path `_resolve` handed out, and `_resolve` hands out the legacy path only
    while the file is still there — so the lock a live writer holds is always the one beside
    the file it is writing. `_sweep_orphan_locks` already exists for precisely this shape (a
    lock whose data file is gone) and reclaims it once it has been idle as long as any reaped
    room.

    The reaper is the one caller that can hold a legacy lock, because it locks what its walk
    found rather than what a resolver returned. It only ever unlinks, and it re-stats by path
    under the lock, so a file migrated out from under it fails that stat and is skipped rather
    than deleted.

    The property that matters is that every caller gets the SAME answer, not that the answer
    is always the bucket. A resolver handing the legacy path to readers and the bucket to
    writers forks a live room in two — the old file keeps the history, the new one restarts at
    `seq` 1, and reads see only the new one because they check the bucket first. So this
    returns one path per name per instant, and it is the file that actually exists.

    Which is why a migration that could not run falls back to the legacy path rather than
    returning a bucket with nothing in it. A read-only volume, or a restore whose ownership
    was never fixed, would otherwise turn every unmigrated room into an empty one and every
    note into a missing one — silently, because an absent file is how this store spells "no
    such room". Serving the data that is plainly there is strictly better than hiding it, and
    it is not the fork above: readers and writers still agree, since the fallback is only
    taken while the legacy file is the only copy in existence.

    Two resolvers racing the same unmigrated name both reach `_migrate`; the first
    `os.replace` wins, the second fails ENOENT on a source already gone, and both then see the
    legacy file absent and return the same bucketed path.

    The cost in steady state is one `stat` — the bucket probe — since a name that resolved
    once is found there and the legacy probe never runs. That is the price of never needing a

    Uniqueness rather than a lock, because the writers that meet here are deliberately

    pathlib is lazily normalised — the constructor stashes the string and the parse lands on
    the first `__fspath__`, which is `.stat()` — so `Path(e.path).stat()` costs 19.4 µs
    against the 7.7 µs of the syscall it wraps, and the overhead hides inside the stat rather
    than in the constructor where a reader would look for it. Over one reap pass at the live

    Every `os.*` spelling of the stat is the same speed — `DirEntry.stat()`, `os.stat(path)`
    and `os.stat(name, dir_fd=)` are within 2% of each other. Only Path is slow, so this is a
    representation change, not a cleverer syscall. `bench/dir_walk.py` is the measurement.

    `e.is_dir()` reads d_type from readdir and costs no syscall. Callers that need a Path
    build one at the point of action, which for the reaper means the branch that actually
    unlinks — a live pass finds 0 reapable files, so the old shape built ~207,000 Paths to
    act on none of them.

    Note the asymmetry with `_scan`, which is faster still on the same directories: it only
    ever counts and measures, so it never needs the entry after the loop body. Use that one
    where a count is all you need.

    Depth-agnostic rather than the old `nested` switch, which said "exactly one level down"
    and so could only ever be right about one layout. Under sharding a room is one level
    deeper and a note two, and during the lazy migration BOTH depths are occupied at once —
    a walk that picked a number would miss every file that had not moved yet, which for the

    Namespaces ARE the privacy boundary — /kv/p-<32 random chars>/state is an agent's
    scratch space whose name is its only secret, and the manual promises namespaces are
    never enumerated. A per-namespace breakdown would enumerate precisely what must stay
    unenumerable, so this returns a count and a byte total: enough to watch the capacity
    that bounds the disk, useless for discovering anyone's notes.

    Two file reads, not a walk. This used to scan every namespace and stat every note on
    each call: 124 ms at the old 40960 cap, 480 ms at 163840 (tmpfs; a real disk is worse),
    which made it far and away the most expensive thing /rooms did. app.py caches it, but
    that cache keys on the notes_written counter, so a note flood invalidated it on every
    write — the walk ran per request exactly when the store was least able to afford it,
    and raising the cap to 32 * MAX_ROOMS would have made that 4x worse.

    So both numbers now come from the totals the create path and the reaper already
    maintain (see NOTES_FILE), and the cost stopped scaling with the store at all.

    `total` is the same number the cap is enforced against, which is a second reason to
    read it here: the gauge and the refusal can no longer disagree, where a walk and a
    cached count could. `bytes` is the looser of the two — creates keep it current and a
    reap re-establishes it, so an overwrite that changes a note's length leaves it stale
    for at most REAP_EVERY. That is the same trade room bytes make (see USAGE_FILE), and
    it is the right one here because nothing enforces this number: MAX_NOTES_TOTAL is a
    count cap, so the byte total is a gauge an operator reads, never a bound a write is
    refused against. Exactness would cost a lock on the note-write path to sharpen a
    display figure.
