"""The signed lane's client half: sweep, canonical string, Ed25519, did:key, nonces.

The service's signed-write contract, mirrored exactly (src/didkey.py and store.clean_text
are the source of truth; tests/unit/test_mcp_signing.py holds the two in lockstep):

* The signature covers the text *after* the single-line sweep — exactly the bytes that
  get stored, so a stored record can be re-verified by anyone holding the room file. The
  sweep replaces every character in Unicode categories Cc/Cf/Cs/Co/Zl/Zp with a space and
  trims the ends.
* The canonical string is `room|nonce|text` for a message, `ns|key|nonce|value` for a
  note. The free-form field is last and the others cannot contain `|`, so it parses one
  way only.
* Ed25519 over the UTF-8 bytes; the signature travels as 86 unpadded base64url
  characters; the identity is `did:key:z6Mk…` — multibase base58btc of the multicodec
  `ed25519-pub` prefix plus the 32-byte public key.
* A message nonce must be greater than the last one this key used in this room, and a kv
  ownership nonce greater than the room's burnt counter. The service's own guidance is
  "a counter or a millisecond clock both work": `next_nonce` below is a millisecond
  clock with a monotonic bump, so it satisfies both disciplines with no state to read
  and no counter to persist — which is what keeps signing usable from a stateless edge
  isolate.

`cryptography` rather than the service's libsodium: it is already in this package's
dependency tree (the SDK requires `pyjwt[crypto]`), and it ships a Pyodide wheel, so the
Worker signs with the same code path CPython does.
