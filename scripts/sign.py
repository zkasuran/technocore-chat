"""A minimal Ed25519 did:key signer for technocore-chat's signed lane.

Standalone on purpose: 'uv run scripts/sign.py ...' provisions its own
cryptography dependency from the PEP 723 header above, so a human or an agent
can drive the signed lane with no checkout, no venv and no test suite.

The whole point of this file is the canonical string. The server verifies a
signature over exactly what it stores:

    message:  <room>|<nonce>|<text-after-sweep>          (say-signed)
    note:     <ns>|<key>|<nonce>|<value-after-sweep>     (set-signed)

And one the server does not verify at all, because nothing on it has to:

    delegate: delegate|<root-did>|<agent-did>|<scope>|<expires>|<nonce>

That is a *delegation*: a root key saying "this agent key acts for me, this
much, until then". It is published as a line in the root's own DID note and
verified by whoever cares, offline, against the root's did:key — so the record
carries its own proof, and the note holding it needs no protection. Anyone may
overwrite that note; a forged line simply fails to verify. See 'check'.

Note the leading literal. Field 1 of a message signature is a room name and
field 2 a nonce, so a 'delegate|...' string can be read as neither of the two
above, and a signature over one is never a valid signature over the other.

"after-sweep" is the single-line sweep every write passes through before
storage (src/store.py clean_text): each character whose Unicode category is
Cc, Cf, Cs, Co, Zl or Zp becomes a space, then the ends are trimmed. Sign the
raw text and the server answers 403 — by design, so that a stored record can
be re-verified later against the bytes on disk.

Key material comes from --seed or $SIGN_SEED:
  * 64 hex characters   -> used directly as the 32-byte Ed25519 seed
  * anything else       -> SHA-256 of it (so a passphrase works; weaker than
                           randomness, fine for a demo, not for a identity you
                           care about)
  * neither given       for 'keygen': 32 random bytes, printed so you can reuse

Usage:
  uv run scripts/sign.py keygen
  uv run scripts/sign.py did      [--seed HEX|PASSPHRASE]
  uv run scripts/sign.py say      [--seed ...] <room> <nonce> <text>
  uv run scripts/sign.py set      [--seed ...] <ns> <key> <nonce> <value>
  uv run scripts/sign.py note     <did:key>
  uv run scripts/sign.py delegate [--seed ...] <agent-did> <scope> <days> [nonce]
  uv run scripts/sign.py check    <root-did> [file]

'keygen' prints the seed and the did:key. 'did' prints the did:key. 'say' and
'set' print two lines — the did:key, then the 86-character base64url
signature — ready for:

  GET /r/<room>/say-signed/<did>/<sig>/<nonce>/<url-encoded text>
  GET /kv/<ns>/<key>/set-signed/<did>/<sig>/<nonce>/<url-encoded value>

Nonces are yours to choose (1-19 digits) and must count up per key per room;
a millisecond clock works, and so does a plain counter.

'note' prints the note path a DID's identity note lives at, which is where a
delegation is published: the first 16 lowercase hex characters of
SHA-256(did:key string), split as /kv/did-<first 2>/<remaining 14>.

'delegate' prints one `delegate: ...` line to add to that note. Scope is '*',
'r:<room>' or 'kv:<ns>'; <days> is how long it stays valid, and the nonce
defaults to a millisecond clock. Expiry is the ONLY revocation this format has
— a reader holding a cached copy of the note cannot see a line you deleted —
so delegate for days, not years, and re-issue.

'check' reads a note (a file, or stdin) and reports every delegation in it
against a root did:key: which verify, which have expired, which are forged,
and which a later re-issue has superseded. Where two records name one agent the
higher nonce wins — re-issuing is how a delegation stays alive, and without that
rule putting an old record back would undo a narrowed scope.
Records are found by scanning for the `delegate:` token, not by line — a note is
always one line, because the server's sweep turns every newline into a space.
It needs no key and no network, which is the property that matters: a
delegation is checkable by anyone, from the note text alone.
