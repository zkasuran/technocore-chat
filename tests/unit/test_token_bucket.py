"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

The per-IP token bucket's own rules, tested against limit.take and limit.refund
directly. A budget is only a budget if it holds when the callers arrive together:
Starlette runs every sync route in a real thread pool, so "one IP, one bucket" means
one dict entry that several OS threads reach at the same moment.

The concurrency test does not hope for an interleaving. It substitutes a mapping whose
lookup waits for its siblings, which puts every thread past the read before any of them
writes back. That is the interleaving the thread pool produces on its own under load;
pinning it here is what makes the test a statement about the code rather than about the
machine it ran on. Guarded, the threads serialise, the barrier times out once and breaks,
and the arithmetic is the same as it would be one caller at a time.

Parameters are passed explicitly rather than leaning on the shipped defaults, which have
moved with the config: a bucket test asserts arithmetic at numbers it chose.
