"""The signing constants /humans restates, pinned to the ones the server verifies against.

The page signs in the browser: it builds `room|nonce|swept-text`, signs it with an Ed25519
key held in `localStorage`, and posts `did`/`sig`/`nonce` to the lane `app.room_post`
already had. Nothing on the server changed for that, which is the point — but it means the
page now carries a second spelling of five things `didkey.py`, `store.py` and
`scripts/sign.py` also spell, and a second spelling is a thing that can drift.

Drift here is quiet and it fails at exactly the wrong moment. Every constant below is used
only on the *send* path, so a wrong byte produces a page that loads, renders, polls and
lists rooms perfectly, and then answers 403 the first time somebody signed in tries to say
something. No Python test of the server catches that: the server is right. The browser
probe (tests/humans_ui_probe.mjs) does catch it, and it is not in CI because it needs
Chromium.

So: read the constants back out of the served page and check them here, where they cost
nothing. Regex extraction rather than a JavaScript engine, for the same reason
test_humans_name_input_limit.py reads `maxlength` that way — the assertion is about a value,
and standing up a JS runtime to read one array is a dependency this suite does not have.
