"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

A room's floor and generation lived in one root-level map that was read and parsed IN FULL on
every room read — `read_messages` asks for the generation — and rewritten in full under one
global lock on every create and every reap. Nothing ever removed an entry, so it grew with
every room the service had ever reaped: 3.2 MB and 42 ms per request at the ~90k of a live
deployment, which is 99% of a read (#489).

It is sharded 256 ways now, by the same `_shard` that resolves a room's own bucket. Three
things have to hold: the split must not lose or reorder a floor or a generation, a read must
answer identically before, during and after it, and the shards must stay out of everything
that walks the store.
