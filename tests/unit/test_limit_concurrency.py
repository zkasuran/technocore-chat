"""Regression tests for _buckets race conditions (Issue #378).

The lock added to _buckets serializes three operations that were racing in production:
1. The read-modify-write of a bucket's balance (two threads both spending the same token)
2. The KeyError from move_to_end on a key another thread just evicted
3. The same pattern in refund()

This file uses a gated OrderedDict to force the interleavings deterministically, matching
the technique already used in tests/unit/test_memo_caches.py for _Gated.
