"""The wrapper's signing mirror, held in lockstep with the service's own primitives.

`mcp/src/technocore_mcp/signing.py` re-implements three things the wrapper cannot import
from the service: the single-line sweep the signature must cover, the did:key encoding,
and the signature encoding. Each is checked here against the service-side original —
`store.clean_text`, `didkey.public_key`, `didkey.verify` — so drift is a red test in this
repo, not a 403 in someone's deployment.
