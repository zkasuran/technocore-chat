"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

Every message written to any room bumps the lifetime counters, and until #588 that meant an
exclusive `flock` on one root-level file, held across a read-parse-modify-replace, taken by
writes to rooms that have nothing to do with each other. A store where one room is busy
therefore serialised writes to every *other* room behind it, on a file neither of them reads.

Two rules replace it. A bump whose only delta is `messages` rides in a process-local bucket
instead of paying for a write at all — that is the one counter bumped on every append, and the
one nothing reads for freshness (`app.py`'s ROOMS_STAMP_KEYS leaves it out on purpose). Every
other key marks a structural event another worker's cache stamp is waiting for, so those still
write immediately; and when they cannot get the lock, `LOCK_NB` means they leave their delta
in the same bucket rather than queueing. Four things have to hold, and only the first is about
speed:

- a bump never waits on that lock, whoever is holding it;
- nothing is lost or counted twice on the way through the bucket — not under concurrent
  threads, and not when a replace fails after the batch has been taken out of it;
- a structural bump still persists immediately, and a riding message is bounded — by the
  next structural bump, by BATCH_MESSAGES, and by the snapshot that samples the digest;
- the bucket stays a fixed six keys and empties itself, so a process is not slowly filled
  by the roots it has finished with.
