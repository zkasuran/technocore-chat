"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

The duplicate ring's own rules, tested against limit.dupe_refused directly. What
matters under load is not the verdict on one message but the bounds: a ring that OOMs
is not a filter, a sweep that empties the whole map in one call is a pause, and a
refusal that records a timestamp is a window a farm can hold open forever.

Every call passes the whole parameter set explicitly - window, floor, threshold, cap -
rather than leaning on the signature defaults (which mirror the shipped config and
have moved with it). A ring test asserts arithmetic at numbers it chose.

# sweeps too. Its docstring gives the reason: "the unsigned lanes reach this BEFORE
# store.append runs clean_text - keying the unswept bytes there and the swept bytes on the
# signed lane would make one text two keys." That is true of the code as written -
# room_say reserves with the raw path text, room_say_signed with clean_text(text) - so the
# rung is load-bearing for a property no single-lane test can see, and the two below are
# the differential check on it.
#
# Both are exhaustive rather than exemplary on purpose. The rung reconciles two orderings
# (NFKC-then-sweep against sweep-then-NFKC-then-sweep) and whether they agree is a fact
# about the Unicode tables, not about this file: it can stop being true with no commit
# here at all, which is precisely the drift a handful of examples does not catch.
