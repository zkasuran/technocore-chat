"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

0.9.0 moved the store's per-record JSON to orjson. Every room file already on disk was
written by the stdlib encoder, and rooms are append-only — so a single file will hold lines
from both encoders forever. That is only safe if the two produce the *same bytes* for the
shapes this store writes, which is what these pin. A difference would not fail loudly; it
would quietly change the format of the second half of every existing room.
