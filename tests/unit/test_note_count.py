"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

The global note cap used to be enforced by walking every namespace on every new note, so a
create cost O(all notes) while the notes were growing. `.notes-count` replaced that walk.
Two things have to hold, and the second is the one that would actually hurt if it broke:
the cost must stop scaling with the store, and the cap must still bind *exactly* — a cached
count that drifts low lets the cap be breached, which is worse than the walk it replaced.

    Two creates and one pass, in the order that breaks it. Create 1 has reserved — the

    Create 2 then finds nothing to read, rebuilds by walking a namespace whose K+1'th note is
    not on disk yet, persists K and reserves K+1 against it. Two notes were made, the file
    moved by one, and the namespace over-admits against MAX_NOTES_PER_NS until something
    rewrites the figure. Both creates hold the span shared, so only an exclusive holder is
    waited out for: the unlink has to take it, exactly as the rmdir beside it does.

    Built rather than timed. The pass is parked where it has just given the span back —
    `_settle_count` done, the drop next — create 1 is parked between its reservation and its
    note write, and create 2 runs in that window. Bounded waits throughout: with the unlink
    under the span the pass cannot finish until create 1 does, so an unconditional wait on it
