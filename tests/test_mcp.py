"""The MCP wrapper, driven against the real service through the real SDK.

Nothing here is stubbed with canned strings. The tools' one network call is redirected
into the actual `app.py` over an in-process ASGI transport, and the calls themselves go
through the SDK's own client and server — handshake, schema validation, content blocks
and all. A tool that builds a URL the service rejects, or advertises a schema the SDK
then refuses, fails here rather than in someone's client.

Two levels, deliberately:

* `mcp` drives the tools through `mcp.client.Client`, which is a real `ClientSession`
  talking to the real server over in-memory streams. Everything about *behaviour* — what
  a tool returns, what it refuses, what `tools/list` publishes — is tested there.
* `wire` posts raw JSON-RPC at the streamable-HTTP app, which is the transport a remote
  deployment serves. Everything about the *envelope* is tested there.
