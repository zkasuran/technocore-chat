    writes itself still gets a caption chosen by a stranger, printed beside it in the
    directory. Marking the listing is what covers that.

    This is also why LISTING_BANNER names the two fields in separate clauses rather than
    crediting both to "whoever wrote to the room". Setting a topic needs no write to the
    room it captions, so one sentence covering both would attribute a stranger's caption
    to the room's own participants — here, to the server.

    isolate. This spawns a real second interpreter against the same CHAT_ROOT and holds a
    long-poll here while it writes, which is the arrangement uvicorn's workers are in.

    Written down as a test because the absence of a `_waiters[room]` event table reads as
    a missing feature: the report it guards against is "multi-worker long-polls never
    wake", and they always did — the process boundary costs one CHAT_WAIT_POLL of latency
