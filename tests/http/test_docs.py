    this suite depend on a draft moving under it. What is pinned instead is the contract as

    reverse-DNS with exactly one slash; `description` is capped at 100 characters; a
    remote's `type` is one of two strings. Those are the ways a card is invalid rather than
    merely unfashionable, and they are cheap to keep true.

    its absence rather than its value. It used to be asserted equal to
