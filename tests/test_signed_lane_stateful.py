"""A Hypothesis state machine over the signed lane's replay defence.

Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests/test_signed_lane_stateful.py

`tests/test_store_stateful.py` models the store's lifecycle — append, read, expire, compact,
reap, note CAS — and never touches a signature. This models the part of the store whose
correctness is a *security* property: `_last_nonce`, which decides whether a captured signed
URL still works.

The contract is bounded by the ring. A signed URL is a bearer token for exactly one message,
so replaying it must fail while the message it wrote is still there to be seen; once the ring
drops that record the replay is accepted again as a fresh message, and `_last_nonce`'s
docstring says so. The bound is the retention model doing what it says rather than a hole.

This file was written against a narrower version of that contract, where the guard scanned the
newest `READ_BUDGET` rather than the whole ring, and four of its tests asserted that narrower
boundary. They are inverted rather than removed, and the paragraphs below record what moved.

WHY THE BOUND IS WHERE IT IS, which used to be somewhere else
-------------------------------------------------------------
"Refused while the original is readable" was not established by anything in `_write_record`. It
held because of a coincidence of two default arguments:

    read_messages    for raw in reverse_lines(f):        <- default max_bytes
    _last_nonce      for raw in reverse_lines(f):        <- default max_bytes

Those were the only two call sites in the module that took `reverse_lines`' default budget, and
the coincidence was doing load-bearing work nothing recorded. `_last_nonce` now names
`MAX_ROOM_BYTES` explicitly, so the guard's reach is a decision rather than a shared default,
and `read_messages` is the only bare call site left. `test_only_the_reader_takes_the_default_
budget` keeps that grep as a locator.

The property, stated carefully, is an ORDERING and not an equality:

    guard depth  >=  visible depth

That is what safety needs, and asserting equality would be asserting the mechanism: the guard is
*allowed* to reach further back than a reader can see, and it does in several places now, since
an expired `e-` record still guards its nonce, a MAX_LIMIT tail can run out of records before it
runs out of budget, and the guard reads the whole retained file where a reader stops at
`READ_BUDGET`. Stricter-than-visible costs nothing and hides nothing. Only the reverse is a hole.

So the thing to hold onto is the direction. `a_visible_record_is_always_still_guarded` asserts it
over the whole state machine, and `test_the_guard_scans_at_least_as_deep_as_a_reader_can_see`
measures both depths directly by giving every record its own key, then pins the guard's remaining
boundary as an equality against physical retention. Neither one counts bytes or restates the scan.

Widening the reader's budget past the guard's would still break the ordering, and it is no longer
reachable by tuning the shared default, because the guard does not take it.
`test_narrowing_only_the_reader_no_longer_makes_a_visible_message_replayable` asserts that: the
state it used to construct on purpose, a record a reader can still see whose nonce is no longer
guarded, cannot be built through `_window` any more. That is what this change buys.

The retention ring is now the boundary rather than a red herring. Records survive on disk for
5-10 MiB (COMPACT_KEEP_BYTES, MAX_ROOM_BYTES), and the guard reads all of it, so *disk* contents
are exactly what says what is guarded. A room file no longer holds records that are readable to
the guard but invisible to it.

Three notes on the model:

- **It asks the implementation for the boundary, then holds it to the consequence.** Rather
  than re-deriving what `_last_nonce` should return — which would test a copy of the scan —
  each rule reads the guard value and asserts `append` refuses at or below it and accepts
  above. What is checked is the *agreement* between two functions called one line apart under
  the same lock, which is where a real bug would live.
- **There is no ordering invariant on nonces on disk.** "One key's nonces ascend by seq" is the
  obvious property and it is FALSE — see `surviving_nonces_may_repeat` for the counterexample
  the model produced within three steps. Anything reading `from` + `nonce` off disk as an
  ordering has to be shown this.
- **The window is tuned down, and it takes a patch to do it.** `READ_BUDGET` is bound into
  `reverse_lines`' default argument, so re-binding the module attribute does nothing — see
  `_window`. That is why this file did not exist sooner: the boundary is unreachable in a test
  without writing a megabyte. It now moves the reader alone, so a test that needs the guard's
  boundary moves `MAX_ROOM_BYTES` with `monkeypatch.setattr` and lets compaction do the work.

    """The security property as an ORDERING, measured rather than read off the source.

    `guard depth >= visible depth`. That is the whole requirement and it is deliberately not
    equality against the reader: the guard is allowed to outlive visibility (an expired `e-`
    record still guards, a MAX_LIMIT tail may not reach as far back as the budget does) because
    stricter-than-visible is the safe direction. Only the other direction is a hole.

    INTENTIONAL INVERSION of the bounded-window contract. The version this file shipped with
    took its slack from a coincidence: both scans took `reverse_lines`' default budget, so the
    guard reached exactly READ_BUDGET and stopped there. It asserted that some key had fallen
    past. `_last_nonce` now names `max_bytes=MAX_ROOM_BYTES` and scans the whole ring, so the
    guard's boundary is physical retention. The bounded window is not the contract any more. What
    replaces it is asserted below as an equality against the ring, the one place the guard may
    still stop.

    That policy change is also the mechanical reason the old version went red, rather than any
    broken invariant. `_window` patches `reverse_lines.__defaults__`, so it still moves the
    reader while a call site naming its own budget is immune to it. Every key stayed guarded and
    the ordering held with more slack than before. What failed was the anti-vacuity guard, on a
    boundary the guard no longer has.

    Measured by giving every record its own key, which makes the depths separately observable: a
    key is *visible* if `read_messages` returns its record, *retained* if the record is still in
    the room file at all, *guarded* if `_last_nonce` still answers for it. Plain set containment,
    with no byte counting and no restatement of the algorithm.

    What the ordering still catches, now that no read budget can break it: a guard that skips a
    record a reader can see. `_last_nonce` passes over a line its byte prefilter misses or whose
    `nonce` is not an int. Either lands here rather than in the equality.

    This replaces an earlier version that counted `reverse_lines(f)` call sites in `store.py`
    and asserted there were exactly two. That asserted sameness at the call site, which is a
    mechanism and the wrong shape: it went red on a harmless reformat and it stayed green for a
    read path naming a *wider* budget explicitly. Widening one is exactly the change that has
    since been made. On the guard's side it satisfies the ordering rather than breaking it.
    Which side a wider budget lands on is what a call-site count cannot tell. The locator below
    keeps the useful half of that grep.

    An intentional inversion of the bounded-window contract. The count went the other way. This

    coincidence of one shared default. `_last_nonce` names MAX_ROOM_BYTES now, so `read_messages`
    is the only caller left taking the default. The ordering has slack instead of none: the guard
    scans the whole ring, a reader scans READ_BUDGET. Stricter-than-visible was always the safe
    direction. It is a decision in the source now rather than a coincidence that a single line
    could quietly spend.

    Still narrow, still a prompt. The count says where to look when this file goes red. It never
    says the ordering holds. A third unbudgeted read path would inherit the READER's reach by

    which it meant. A change to `read_messages`' own call site lands here too, because naming any
    budget there takes the count to zero. Adjust the count and move on.
