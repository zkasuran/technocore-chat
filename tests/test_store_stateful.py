"""A Hypothesis state machine over the store's lifecycle.

Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests/test_store_stateful.py

Every rule in `store.py` is easy to satisfy alone; what is hard is satisfying all of them
at once, in an order nobody wrote a test for. So the interesting bugs live in the
*sequences*: a seq reused after a compaction that kept nothing, a cursor that skips a
record because expiry and `since` disagree about which end of the file to stop at, a guard
note reclaimed while the room it guards is still busy.

Two things about the model:

- It does not predict compaction byte-for-byte. The contract is "keep the newest that fit,
  drop the rest, never reorder and never renumber", so the machine reads back what survived
  and holds *that* to it, rather than re-implementing `_compact` and testing the copy.
- Time moves the whole store into the past: file mtimes *and* record timestamps. The reaper
  stats the file and `e-` expiry parses the record, so ageing one without the other
  produces a store that has never existed.

        in the namespace — so the next rule that touches that name has to migrate it.

        The model deliberately does not move. Where a file sits is not one of the promises
        this machine holds the store to, and that is the whole claim: `seq`, the surviving
        history, a note's value and the reaper's clock all have to come through the move
        untouched, in whatever order Hypothesis happens to reach it.

        The sequence is what makes this worth a rule rather than an example. Migrating on read
        while writing to the bucket forks a live room in two — old file keeps the history, new
        file restarts at `seq` 1 — and no single-step test sees it, because each step alone
        looks correct. `say`'s existing "seq jumped" assertion is what catches it, one step
        later, and only if something put the file back first.

        `os.replace` keeps mtime, so the ageing model stays true across the move. The sidecar
        lock goes too: a real pre-sharding store has both flat, and moving one without the
        other would test a state that never existed.
